Assignment 2 from CSCI 381: Applied Data Science. Score 99/100

In this project you will construct machine learning models on two different real-world datasets using unsupervised learning and regression. The datasets include a forest coverage dataset and a crime dataset. Follow directions written out in the jupyter notebook.

You will work independently on the project. Please make use of the Python Data Science Reference Materials posted on Blackboard or come to office hours should you need further assistance. You will submit a single Jupyter notebook containing all code and written responses via Blackboard by the due date listed above. Your Jupyter notebook must be able to run from start to finish without error. Please turn any cell that contains scratch work or other non-executable items to Raw. Notebooks that cannot run to completion will receive a grade of 0.
